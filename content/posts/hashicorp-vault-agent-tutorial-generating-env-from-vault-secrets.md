In this tutorial, we will set up Vault Agent to generate a `.env` file with secrets from HashiCorp Vault. We'll use the AppRole authentication method to securely authenticate and retrieve secrets, then write them to an environment file for use in your application.

You can find the complete configuration files and setup used in this tutorial in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/hamidhaghdoost/vault-agent-tutorial).

⚠️ **Important Note:** This tutorial uses Vault in development mode (`-dev`) for simplicity. Development mode is **not secure** and should only be used for testing and learning purposes. In a production environment:
- Use a properly initialized and unsealed Vault server.
- Secure the Vault server with TLS certificates and access control.

## Prerequisites

- Vault server running (in development mode for testing)
- Vault Agent installed and configured
- Basic knowledge of Vault and its authentication methods

## Step 1: Start Vault Server in Development Mode

We'll start Vault in development mode for testing purposes. This will make Vault accessible via `127.0.0.1:8200` with a root token.

Run the following command:

```bash
vault server -dev -dev-root-token-id=root -dev-tls
```

Then export `VAULT_ADDR` and `VAULT_CACERT` from the output of the previous command to give the CLI the ability to access the Vault server:

```bash
export VAULT_ADDR='https://127.0.0.1:8200'
export VAULT_CACERT='/tmp/vault-tls900287623/vault-ca.pem'
```

And create two dummy secrets as the username and password of a database that we will later write to an environment variable:

```bash
vault kv put secret/dbinfo user=root pass=test123
```

Access Vault's UI by navigating to [https://127.0.0.1:8200](https://127.0.0.1:8200) and logging in with the `root` token.

## Step 2: Set Up the AppRole Authentication Method

We will use AppRole for authentication. First, enable the AppRole authentication method:

```bash
vault auth enable approle
```

Next, create a new AppRole and attach a policy that allows reading from the `secret/data/dbinfo` path:

1. **Create the Vault policy (`agent-policy.hcl`)**:
    ```hcl
    path "secret/data/dbinfo" {
      capabilities = ["read"]
    }
    ```

2. **Write the policy**:
    ```bash
    vault policy write agent-policy agent-policy.hcl
    ```

3. **Create the AppRole and attach the policy**:
    ```bash
    vault write auth/approle/role/vault-agent-role policies="agent-policy"
    ```

4. **Generate the `role_id` and `secret_id`**:
    ```bash
    vault read auth/approle/role/vault-agent-role/role-id
    vault write -f auth/approle/role/vault-agent-role/secret-id
    ```

The `role_id` and `secret_id` are required to authenticate via AppRole. Save these values to the files `role_id` and `secret_id`.

## Step 3: Configure Vault Agent

The Vault Agent configuration file (`vault-agent.hcl`) will authenticate with Vault using the AppRole and generate a `.env` file with the secret values. Here's an example configuration:

```hcl
# Vault Agent configuration
vault {
  address = "https://127.0.0.1:8200"
  token = "<client_token>"
}

auto_auth {
  method "approle" {
    mount_path = "auth/approle"
    config = {
      role_id_file_path = "./role_id"
      secret_id_file_path = "./secret_id"
    }
  }

  sink "file" {
    path = "./vault-agent-token"
  }
}

template {
  source      = "./env-template.tmpl"
  destination = "./.env"
}
```

**Explanation**:
- The `role_id_file_path` and `secret_id_file_path` point to the files containing the AppRole credentials.
- The `template` block specifies the path to the `env-template.tmpl` file and the destination for the generated `.env` file.

## Step 4: Create the Template File (`env-template.tmpl`)

Create a template file (`env-template.tmpl`) that Vault Agent will use to generate the `.env` file. Here's an example template:

```plaintext
DB_USER={{ with secret "secret/data/dbinfo" }}{{ .Data.data.user }}{{ end }}
DB_PASS={{ with secret "secret/data/dbinfo" }}{{ .Data.data.pass }}{{ end }}
```

This template will insert the `user` and `pass` from the Vault secrets into the `.env` file.

## Step 5: Start Vault Agent

Now, we will start the Vault Agent to authenticate and generate the `.env` file:

```bash
vault agent -config=./vault-agent.hcl
```

Vault Agent will authenticate using AppRole, retrieve the secret from `secret/data/dbinfo`, and generate the `.env` file at the specified location.

## Step 6: Check the Generated `.env` File

After Vault Agent runs, the `.env` file will be populated with the secrets from Vault:

```plaintext
DB_USER=root
DB_PASS=test123
```

This file can now be used to set environment variables for your application.

Your final files should look like this:

```plaintext
agent-policy.hcl
env-template.tmpl
role_id
secret_id
vault-agent.hcl
vault-agent.pid
vault-agent-token
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we've configured Vault Agent to authenticate with Vault using AppRole, retrieve secrets, and generate a `.env` file. This is a simple and secure way to manage sensitive configuration data in your application.

I hope this tutorial helps you get Vault Agent running smoothly. Happy coding!
