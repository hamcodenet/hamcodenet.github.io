Hi, my name is Hamid Haghdoost. I'm a Senior Software Developer at Fondazione Bruno Kessler (FBK) in Trento, Italy, with nearly five years of experience in web development. I focus on writing reliable, testable, and maintainable code, with expertise in PHP, Laravel, Golang, and cloud infrastructure. I hold a Master's degree in Computer Science from IASBS, where I specialized in computational linguistics and morphological segmentation for Persian language processing.

Currently at FBK, I design and deploy microservices on cloud platforms like DigitalOcean and Azure, manage CI/CD pipelines with GitLab CI and ArgoCD, and provision infrastructure using Terraform and Kubernetes. Previously, I was a Senior Back-end Developer at Jajiga, where I optimized high-traffic endpoints and implemented advanced caching strategies. I also co-founded Anzalifood, a successful food ordering platform in Iran, where I led product development and scaled the business.

Beyond work, I'm passionate about group sports like football and enjoy spending time outdoors. I'm always eager to learn, whether through podcasts or trying new sports.
